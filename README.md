# dotfiles

used on all my linux boxes (current: WSL2 on my Windows laptop)

to recreate my setup, you need:
- [oh my zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)
- [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) for (neo)vim

then clone this repo and execute make.sh on the dotfiles directory
(usually in $HOME).
